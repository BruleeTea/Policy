# Policy-Management-System
Purpose:
The purpose of this coding project is to create a Java-based Policy Management System that simulates the management of individual and company client policies. The system will perform the following tasks:

Display the initial policies for individual and company clients, including their respective details such as policy type, amount, and expiry information.
Allow for the submission of claims for specific policies and update the policy amounts accordingly.
Display the policies after claims have been processed, reflecting the updated amounts.
Simulate policy cancellations and track the success of the cancellation attempts.
Calculate and display the total policy coverage for both individual and company clients.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for managing policies, tracking claims, and monitoring policy cancellations. It will serve as a useful application for insurance companies or similar organizations.
